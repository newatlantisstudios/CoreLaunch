Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using CoreLaunch, you agree to the terms and practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our application.
No Data Collection
CoreLaunch is designed with complete privacy as a core value. We do not collect any personal information or data from your device. The app functions entirely with local processing on your device, with no data being transmitted to us or any third parties.
How CoreLaunch Works Without Data Collection
CoreLaunch functions without collecting or storing any user data:
All app settings and preferences remain solely on your device
App usage statistics are processed locally and are not stored or transmitted
Focus session timers operate entirely within your device's memory
No analytics or usage tracking occurs
No user accounts are created or maintained
Third-Party Services
CoreLaunch functions as a standalone application and does not integrate with third-party services for data collection or processing. We do not:
Use third-party analytics
Incorporate advertising networks
Integrate social media platforms
Share data with external services
The only interaction with external applications occurs when you choose to launch an app through CoreLaunch using standard iOS app URL schemes.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide a notice through the application before the changes take effect. Your continued use of CoreLaunch after we post changes to the Privacy Policy means you accept those changes.
California Privacy Rights and International Data Transfers
